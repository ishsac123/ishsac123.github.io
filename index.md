My name is Ishika, and I'm a Health Policy PhD student at UC Berkeley. I'm 
interested in researching healthcare delivery improvement and social and 
clinical care coordination strategies. I'm passionate about improving the 
model of care delivery in the U.S., inclusive of social determinants of 
health.  

Outside of public health, I love reading, cooking, NYT mini games, and 
spending time with family.
